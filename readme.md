    ACME Bank Management System (Python Project)
This project is a terminal-based banking application developed in Python using object-oriented programming (OOP), file handling, and exception handling. It manages customer accounts stored in a CSV file (bank.csv) and provides core banking functionalities including:
Adding new customers with checking and/or savings accounts
Depositing and withdrawing money
Transferring funds between accounts or to other customers
Implementing overdraft protection with limits, fees, and account activation/deactivation rules
The system follows a test-driven development (TDD) approach and supports features like automatic or manual customer ID generation, password verification, and transaction logging.

CSV Module – For reading/writing customer and transaction data

OOP (Classes & Methods) – To structure accounts, customers, and transactions

Exception Handling – For robust error management

Unittest / TDD – Test-driven development for functionality verification

Git & GitHub – Version control and project management</a></li>

      <a href="#Example of your code that I proud of">learning from multiple programming languages and YouTube tutorials to fully understand the concept. I really enjoyed working on it.

This section handles core account operations for customers, including:

Depositing money into checking or savings accounts

Withdrawing money with error handling if the account type doesn’t exist

Transferring funds between a customer’s own accounts

Transferring money to another customer in the same bank, with verification and proper logging

It demonstrates my understanding of OOP principles, method delegation, and safe transaction handling.</a>
